# MCP Vibe Inspector

![MCP Vibe Inspector screenshot](media/screenshot-1.png)

Debug and inspect Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers right inside VS Code.

This extension embeds the MCP Vibe Inspector in a Webview Panel and provides a lightweight sidebar to quickly configure and launch your Inspector instance—no context switch to the browser needed.

## ✨ Features

- Seamless MCP Vibe Inspector panel inside VS Code
- Sidebar launcher with URL input and client-side validation
- **Bearer Token textbox and copy icon in sidebar**
- **MCP URL textbox and copy icon in sidebar**
- Loading/error overlay to avoid blank screens and provide quick Retry
- Copy-to-clipboard for inline code snippets and sidebar fields (icon-only buttons)
- Theme-aware, accessible UI using VS Code design tokens
- Remembers your last URL and panel state
- **NEW in 1.1.0:** Run multiple inspection sessions/tabs at once. Debug and inspect several MCP servers in parallel, each in its own tab for maximum productivity.
- **NEW in 2.1.0:** Bearer Token and MCP URL sidebar fields with copy-to-clipboard support.
- **NEW in 2.0.0:** One-click Start Inspector from the sidebar. The extension will run the Inspector in your integrated terminal (using the exact manual command) and provide a clear fallback copyable command if terminal launch fails.

## 🚀 Getting started

1. **Start the MCP Vibe Inspector with one click:**

- Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux) or open the MCP Vibe Inspector sidebar from the Activity Bar.
- Click the **Start Inspector** button in the sidebar. This runs the exact command used in manual workflows in an integrated terminal:

  ```
  npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
  ```

- Behavior:
  - The Inspector is launched in your integrated terminal so you can see logs and any authentication tokens that appear in stdout.
  - If the Start button fails to launch the Inspector (rare), use the fallback command above — a copy button is provided next to it in the sidebar for one-click copy.
  - After Inspector starts, copy the Inspector URL from the terminal output (it contains the required MCP_PROXY_AUTH_TOKEN) and paste it into the sidebar input. Click Open Inspector to open the panel.
  - You can also enter your Bearer Token and MCP URL in their respective sidebar fields. Use the copy icon next to each field to quickly copy the value to your clipboard for use in other tools or workflows.

2. Open the Inspector panel:

- Command Palette → “Open MCP Vibe Inspector”
- Or via the Activity Bar “MCP” view

3. Paste or confirm your Inspector URL in the panel header. Example:

```
http://localhost:6274/?MCP_PROXY_AUTH_TOKEN=…
```

4. Press Enter or click Reload. If loading takes too long, you’ll see a helpful overlay with a Retry action.

## 🧭 Commands

## ⚙️ Settings

## 📝 Sidebar Fields

- **Inspector URL**: Paste the Inspector URL (with token) here to open the Inspector panel.
- **Bearer Token**: Enter your Bearer Token for authentication. Use the copy icon to copy it.
- **MCP URL**: Enter your MCP server URL. Use the copy icon to copy it.

- `mcpDebugger.inspectorUrl` (string)
  - Default: `http://localhost:3000`
  - The URL where MCP Vibe Inspector is running. Must be http/https and typically includes `MCP_PROXY_AUTH_TOKEN`.

Settings UI: File → Preferences → Settings → search for “MCP Vibe Inspector”.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

- “Still loading…” overlay appears
  - The Inspector may be slow or unreachable. Verify the URL and network, then use Retry.
- “Failed to load the inspector”
  - Check that your Inspector process is running and accessible from VS Code.
- Invalid URL error
  - Ensure the URL starts with http/https and includes the `MCP_PROXY_AUTH_TOKEN` query parameter when required.

## ❓ FAQ

- Does this extension send telemetry?
  - No. There is no telemetry.
- Can I open in a separate window instead?
  - The extension focuses on an embedded experience; you can still open the same URL in your browser if preferred.
